// ***OVERVIEW***
// This tool is going to be a network generator for Shadow of the Beanstalk.
// Version 1.0 is going to allow the GM to select a network type (building, remote site, apartment,
// small office, bar, etc.) select a size (large network, small network, etc.) and difficulty (how
// generally difficult the ICE protecting the nodes of the network will be)
//
// I'm still learning the way running network encounters works in SotB, so this project may
// be a little wonky as I build it
//
/*
Steps I'm going to take:
1) Building the basic functionality of the program while I learn the net encounter rules
2) Put the basic functional pieces together so I can atleast randomly generate a network
3) Implement the UI
4) Put the UI and the program together so that the GM only has to use the webpage to generate the network
4) Touch up the UI
5) Balance the encounters
6) Use the program in my games

//just testing to see if it can grab one of the items from the systems array
//console.log(systems[Math.floor(Math.random() * systems.length)]);
let j = Math.floor(Math.random() * systems.length);
console.log(j);
console.log(systems[j]);

//next:
/*
1) List basic ICE
2) List Advanced ICE
3) List Extreme ICE (if there is any)

4) Create a slider mechanic from 1-5 that pulls from all 3 ICE lists based on the difficulty:
    ie. at 1, it randomly pulls from just Basic ICE, at 2 it pulls randomly from basic and HAS A CHANCE
    to pull from Advanced ICE, at 3 it pulls mostly from advanced and sometimes basic, at 4 it pulls from
    advanced and has a chance to pull from extreme, and at 5 it pulls mainly from extreme
